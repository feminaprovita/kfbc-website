      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I hate politics, always have. Something about it seems to bring out the worst in people. In the months leading up to the 2016 election, the nastiness just kept escalating&mdash;but then, unlike the elections I remember before, it didn't subside after the matter was settled. Everything got even uglier!</p>
      <p>But I wasn't interested in leaving facebook; how else would I watch my friends' cute kids grow up, keep on top of social events, and generally stay in contact with people? Well, one day it hit me:</p>
      <p>What if I ask people some kind of silly question, and they're only allowed to answer in a lighthearted fashion? No politics, no meanness. Would this be fun? Would it work?</p>
      <p>More than two years later (at the creation of this website), the answer seems to be a resounding yes!</p>
      <p>Sometimes friends bemoan to me that my questions have never gone viral, but I'm glad they haven't. I think a real part of their charm is that, even though you're conversing with strangers, they're only one degree of separation away from being your friends, too.</p>
      <p>Anyway, welcome to my archive. It's a little nuts, but hey, why not?</p>
