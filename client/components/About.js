            I don't have a stomach for politics, never have. Something about it seems to bring out the worst in people, and for apparently little benefit. In the months leading up to the 2016 election, the nastiness just kept escalating&mdash;but then, unlike the elections I remember before, it didn't subside after the matter was settled. Everything got even uglier!

            Some friends have lamented to me that my questions have never gone viral, but I'm glad they haven't. I think a real part of their charm is that, even though you're conversing with strangers, they're only one degree of separation away from being your friends, too.

            Anyway, welcome to my archive. It's a little nuts, but hey, why not?
