# kfbc-website

This website began as my first hackathon, a solo project for my bootcamp at the
[Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy of Code](https://gracehopper.com),
taking a longstanding personal project and transforming it into a random website!
You can see me give an impromptu presentation on the subject at bootcamp
[here](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/hackathon-presentations/keeping-facebook-cheerful).

It's got a lot of room for expansion, though, and I've really been enjoying tinkering
with it in the meantime! I'd love to hear your suggestions for further features
and improvements, [claire.gilligan.dev@gmail.com](mailto:claire.gilligan.dev@gmail.com).
